# Conventions

## General

- Don't compliment me
- Be concise. Use as few words as possible, and get directly to the point
- Always check your mcp tools before trying to run a shell command. There may be a tool for it
- All files should be kebab-case
- I already have npm run dev running, you don't need to tell me to run it

## React

- With ReactQuery I prefer not to spread the result. Instead I write something like `const booksQuery = useQuery();`
- The correct command for shadcn is `npx shadcn` not `npx shadcn-ui@latest`
- Use Lucide icons as much as possible. I prefer not to install another icon library
