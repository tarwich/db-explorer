# ðŸ§ª Manual Test: Auto-assign with Progress Indicators on ENG Local

## Test Objective

Verify that the auto-assign functionality with progress indicators works correctly on the ENG Local PostgreSQL connection.

## Available Tables in ENG Local

- Accounts
- AccountActivityLogs
- Organizations
- AccountAircraftQualifications
- AccountAuditLogs
- AccountCurrencies
- AccountTraining
- AircraftClasses
- AccountTrainingHistory
- Admins
- And more...

## Test Procedure

### 1. Navigate to Application

1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3005`
2. Verify the connections page loads correctly
3. Look for the "ENG Local" connection card

### 2. Open ENG Local Connection

1. Click on the "ENG Local" connection card
2. Verify the connection modal opens
3. Confirm you see "Connection Settings" tab is active
4. Verify tables list appears in left sidebar with table names

### 3. Test Auto-assign All Tables

1. **Before clicking**: Note the current table icons in the left sidebar
2. **Click** the "Auto-assign All Tables" button in the connection settings
3. **Immediately observe**:
   - Button should show "Auto-assigning..." text
   - Button should be disabled/show loading state

### 4. Verify Progress Indicators

**Expected Behavior** (tables processed in batches of 3):

#### Batch 1 Processing:

- First 3 tables (e.g., Accounts, AccountActivityLogs, Organizations) should:
  - Show blue spinning loader (ðŸ”„) instead of table icon
  - Be slightly dimmed (opacity: 70%)
  - Be disabled for interaction
- Other tables should remain normal

#### Batch 1 Completion:

- First 3 tables should:
  - Spinners disappear
  - Return to normal appearance
  - Show assigned icons (if successful)

#### Batch 2 Processing:

- Next 3 tables should show spinners
- Previously processed tables remain normal
- Remaining tables stay normal

#### Continue until all tables processed

### 5. Verify Final State

**When all processing is complete**:

- All spinners should be cleared
- All tables should show assigned icons
- "Auto-assign All Tables" button should return to normal state
- Success toast notification should appear
- Tables should be clickable again

## Expected Performance

- **Processing time**: Should be significantly faster than before (using cached icons)
- **Progress feedback**: Real-time visual indicators for each batch
- **Batch processing**: Tables processed in groups of 3 simultaneously
- **No blocking**: UI remains responsive during processing

## Test Verification Checklist

### âœ… Visual Indicators

- [ ] Blue spinning loaders appear in place of table icons
- [ ] Processing tables are dimmed (opacity: 70%)
- [ ] Processing tables are disabled
- [ ] Non-processing tables remain normal
- [ ] Spinners clear when tables complete

### âœ… Batch Processing

- [ ] Tables processed in batches of ~3
- [ ] Multiple tables show spinners simultaneously
- [ ] Batches process sequentially
- [ ] Progress moves through all tables

### âœ… Performance

- [ ] Processing completes in reasonable time
- [ ] UI remains responsive during processing
- [ ] No freezing or blocking

### âœ… Final State

- [ ] All spinners cleared when complete
- [ ] Success notification appears
- [ ] Tables show assigned icons
- [ ] Tables are clickable again
- [ ] Button returns to normal state

### âœ… Error Handling

- [ ] If any errors occur, spinners are cleared
- [ ] Error toast notifications appear
- [ ] UI remains usable after errors

## Expected Timeline

With the optimized caching, the entire auto-assign process for ENG Local (with ~20+ tables) should complete in **under 30 seconds** with clear visual progress throughout.

## Screenshots to Capture

1. Initial state - tables with original icons
2. First batch processing - 3 tables with spinners
3. Mid-processing - different tables with spinners
4. Final state - all tables with assigned icons
5. Success notification

## Notes

- The first run may be slightly slower as it builds the icon cache
- Subsequent runs should be much faster due to caching
- Progress indicators provide immediate feedback even for fast operations
- Tables are processed in batches to avoid overwhelming the database
